# VideoPile: Serve your content, yourself.

## Setup

- Create a `videos` folder and add your content into that folder.
- (Optional) Create a .txt file with the same name as the video, which will act as your description.
- Install dependencies:

```
yarn (requires yarn, recommended)

npm i (uses npm)
```

- Start the server with `npm run start`
